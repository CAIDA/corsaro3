# Number of packet processing threads to use
pktthreads: 8

# All of our captured packets are standard Ethernet with no extra meta-data
# and come from an ERF-based source (e.g. Endace DAG)
# so we can get tell corsarowdcap to assume a constant ERF framing size of 18.
# This offers some performance improvements at high packet rates.
# Comment out this option if you are not using an ERF-based source or think
# that your ERF framing size is unlikely to be a constant value.

# Configuration for the nDAG multicast group that will be used to deliver
# tagged packets to downstream clients
multicast:

  # A unique identifier for this corsarotagger instance

  # The port number to use for transmitting nDAG beacon messages
  beaconport: 8811

  # The multicast group address to use for transmitting nDAG messages
  groupaddr: 225.100.0.100

  # The address of the interface to transmit nDAG messages onto
  sourceaddr: 10.200.0.1

  # The maximum size of an nDAG message (i.e. expected MTU minus some headroom)
  mtu: 1400

  # The TTL to set on all nDAG multicast packets

# Configuration for specific tag-data providers that are supported by
# this tool. Basic tagging will always take place, regardless of what is
# included in this section of the config file.
# Other tagging will only occur if the relevant provider is correctly
# configured here.
