corsaroftmerge is a tool that merges the interim flowtuple avro files
produced by corsarotrace (with the flowtuple plugin) into a single,
correctly ordered, file.

Running corsaroftmerge
======================

To use corsaroftmerge, run the following command:

    ./corsaroftmerge -o <output filename> -l <logmode> <input file 1> ...
                <input file N>

corsaroftmerge will read from the input files supplied and combine them
into a single output file at the location specified with the `-o` option.

Notes:
  * The input files must be interim files generated by the flowtuple plugin.
    These files will have names that end in "--0", "--1", etc.
  * The flowtuple plugin must have been run with the `sorttuples` option
    set to `yes`. Unsorted flowtuples can be easily merged with the `concat`
    tool in the existing avro tools.
  * The output file will be compressed using deflate.
